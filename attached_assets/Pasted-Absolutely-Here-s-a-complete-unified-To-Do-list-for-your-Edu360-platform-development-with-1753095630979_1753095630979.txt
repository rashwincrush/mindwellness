Absolutely. Here's a **complete, unified To-Do list** for your **Edu360+ platform** development with **Replit + Supabase + Vercel**. This list combines **all frontend, backend, deployment, and architecture setup tasks** without skipping a single detail. All API integrations (like ChatGPT, Twilio, Maps, etc.) are marked to be handled **outside this development phase** â€” so they will be left as placeholders or stubs.

## ðŸ”§ To-Do List for Edu360+ Development

1. **Start with Replit as your AI-powered dev assistant**, but use it only for development and testing â€” not for hosting or deployment.

2. In Replit, begin by building the full **frontend UI using React and TailwindCSS**. Focus on these components and pages:

   * Login and Signup screens (with role selection: student, teacher, parent, counselor, admin)
   * Mood Check-in interface: emoji selector, journal input, and an AI chatbot button (AI functionality to be added later)
   * Anonymous Reporting form: allow voice, image, and text uploads (functionality placeholders only)
   * Emergency Panic Button UI: shows userâ€™s location but doesnâ€™t send it anywhere yet
   * Counselor Dashboard: show case logs, flagged students, chat placeholder
   * Admin Console: display mood trends, audit logs, alerts
   * Parent Portal: view mood check-ins and real-time trip alert interface
   * Additional pages: index.jsx, dashboard.jsx, mood.jsx, reports.jsx, emergency.jsx

3. Organize the frontend into the following folder structure:

   ```
   /src
     /components
       - MoodCheckin.jsx
       - PanicButton.jsx
       - AnonymousReportForm.jsx
       - CounselorDashboard.jsx
       - AdminAnalyticsPanel.jsx
     /pages
       - index.jsx
       - login.jsx
       - dashboard.jsx
       - emergency.jsx
       - mood.jsx
       - reports.jsx
   /supabase
     - supabaseClient.js
     - rls.sql (to hold role-based access policies for documentation)
   /utils
     - aiAnalysis.js (just a stub function returning placeholder data)
     - notification.js (placeholder function, no actual API integration)
   .env (testing keys only, donâ€™t hardcode anything)
   README.md (deployment + usage instructions)
   ```

4. Once frontend screens are built, move to the Supabase database schema design.

5. In Supabase (via SQL Editor), manually create the following tables using SQL with UUID primary keys and `created_at`/`updated_at` columns:

   * `users`: link this to Supabase Auth and include role (student, counselor, admin, etc.)
   * `mood_checkins`: fields for mood emoji, journal text, mood\_score, user\_id
   * `anonymous_reports`: report type, media file URL, text input, timestamp
   * `panic_alerts`: location, user\_id, triggered timestamp
   * `wellness_cases`: for counselor case handling and escalation logs
   * `counselor_notes`: notes on individual cases written by counselors
   * `parent_notifications`: logs of alerts sent to parents
   * `trip_tracking`: real-time bus tracking fields (status, student\_id, location, timestamp)

6. Define RLS (Row-Level Security) for each table:

   * Users can only read/write their own mood\_checkins
   * Counselors can access their assigned cases and notes
   * Admins have unrestricted access
   * Anonymous reports should be write-only with no read access for the submitter

7. Back in Replit, connect your Supabase instance using `supabaseClient.js` with:

   * `SUPABASE_URL`
   * `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     Use `.env` to store them for testing locally.

8. Set up **React Context Provider** to manage:

   * Supabase session (auth status)
   * Role-based UI rendering (e.g., show admin console only for admins)

9. Enable **Supabase Realtime** listeners for:

   * `panic_alerts` table: notify admin/counselor UI instantly when triggered
   * `mood_checkins` table: reflect trends or counselor triggers live

10. Add Supabase Edge Functions folder in project for:

* Emergency broadcast (SMS/email) â€“ **leave API code as placeholder**
* AI mood analysis for journals using OpenAI â€“ **leave as stub**
* Escalation logic for counselor cases â€“ **logic only, trigger only**

11. Avoid any external API integrations during development. Only add **placeholder files** and **comments** where they will be plugged in later. This includes:

* ChatGPT (for AI analysis)
* Twilio (for SMS alerts)
* Google Maps or GPS APIs (for location sharing)
* Firebase Push Notifications
* WhatsApp Business APIs

12. Push your Replit project to GitHub â€” this acts as the version-controlled codebase for Vercel to deploy from.

13. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel. Configure it to auto-deploy on every push to `main`.

14. In Vercel, set up these environment variables (use dummy/stub values for now where APIs arenâ€™t implemented):

* `SUPABASE_URL`â†’ to be added later
* `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`â†’ to be added later
* `OPENAI_API_KEY` â†’ to be added later
* `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` â†’ to be added later
* `MAPS_API_KEY` â†’ to be added later

15. Write a README.md that includes:

* Project overview and purpose
* Local dev setup instructions (Replit)
* How to set up Supabase and paste schema
* How to deploy via GitHub to Vercel
* List of planned integrations (AI, emergency notifications) to be implemented later

16. Do **not** use Replit hosting, Replit DB, or deploy directly from Replit â€” keep it only as your development playground.

17. Make sure your frontend is 100% responsive and accessible on mobile screens, since school staff and parents may access via phones.

18. Leave all chatbot, emergency alert triggers, and AI analysis buttons wired visually, but **non-functional until APIs are added in next stage.**

19. After this full development is complete and tested:

* Revisit `utils/aiAnalysis.js` and replace placeholder with OpenAI API
* Add actual Twilio/SMTP logic to `notification.js`
* Replace location mock with real GPS/map API in panic button

20. Once API logic is added externally, deploy final updates to Vercel and consider adding CI/CD protections (like preview deployments for test branches).

Let me know if you want:

* Full SQL schema right now to paste into Supabase
* The stub file contents for AI and notifications
* A complete README.md template ready to drop into your project directory
* A full repo starter ZIP or GitHub-ready scaffold

I'm ready to build it out next.
