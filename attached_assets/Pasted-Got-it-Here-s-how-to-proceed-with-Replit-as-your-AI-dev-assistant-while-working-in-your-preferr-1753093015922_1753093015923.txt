Got it! Here’s how to proceed with **Replit as your AI dev assistant** while working in your preferred order:

---

### 🧠 Instruct Replit (Step-by-Step)

#### ✅ Step 1: Build the Frontend First

> “Replit, generate the complete frontend UI for Edu360+ — an AI-powered mental wellness and school safety platform.
> Focus on these screens:
>
> * Login / Signup (role-based: student, teacher, parent, counselor, admin)
> * Mood Check-in Interface (emoji + journal + AI chatbot button)
> * Anonymous Reporting (voice, photo, text upload)
> * Emergency Panic Button (location-aware)
> * Counselor Dashboard (case logs, flagged students, chat)
> * Admin Console (alerts, mood trends, audit logs)
> * Parent Portal (view mood reports, real-time trip alerts)
>   Use **React + TailwindCSS**, and assume Supabase will be connected later.”

---

#### ✅ Step 2: Request the Supabase Schema

Once frontend UI is ready:

> “Replit, now generate the complete Supabase schema for the above app.
> I will manually paste this into the Supabase SQL editor.
> Make sure all tables include UUID primary keys, `created_at`, `updated_at` timestamps, and role-based RLS logic.
> Include:
>
> * users (linked to Supabase auth)
> * mood\_checkins
> * anonymous\_reports
> * panic\_alerts
> * wellness\_cases
> * parent\_notifications
> * counselor\_notes
> * trip\_tracking
>   Return the full schema in SQL format ready for direct execution.”

---

#### ✅ Step 3: Backend & Supabase Connection

Once schema is added in Supabase:

> “Replit, now connect all frontend logic to the Supabase instance.
> Use environment variables for URL and anon key.
> Add real-time listeners for panic\_alerts and mood\_checkins.
> Use Supabase Edge Functions for:
>
> * emergency broadcast (SMS/email)
> * AI mood analysis (OpenAI)
> * counselor escalation triggers
>   Use context provider for user session and role access control.”

### 🧩 Result

You now have a **modular, production-ready stack** built step by step:

1. Frontend UI (React + Tailwind on Vercel)
2. Supabase schema (added once manually)
3. Backend logic connected (Replit → Supabase)

Would you like me to draft the **full Supabase schema now** so you can paste it directly when ready?
